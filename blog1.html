          Every parents tell us that why you are sitting front of pc and only playing games, gaming is for fun and you
          connot earn, stop playing games and etc.

     <p class="game-p">
          But my personal opinion on gaming is that if you are liable to play games then this field is your you. Gaming
          inside is big market and it expand faster. Now a times one gamer exist in a family. Gaming is also great
          earning platform.

     <div class="question">How we can earn from gaming? </div>
     
     <p class="game-p">
          This is the basic question everyone think in the before introducing your self in this field. I also got same question when I started gaming. In this field there are multiple way to earn and also become (nothing from something). Everyone think that I should become a famous gamer like Mortal, dynamo and etc.  There are many ways to get success in gaming.

     <div class="head-points">1. Upload gaming videos on YouTube.</div>

     <p class="game-p">
          This is the excellent platform to start you gaming journey.  If you have mobile then also you can start recording videos, doing Livestream and more. Now a days facecam values are getting popular put facecam.  Just request a hard work to fulfill your goals. Upload videos regular it will take a time but in future success is waiting for us.

Commentary is nothing but entertaining your viewers by cracking jokes making fun. And maybe in future you will get a chance to commentary in big organized tournaments On your YouTube video make the subscribe that they should watch your voice and entertain them just telling jokes and they should not get boor and alone my be you loose your subscribe.
